# hook

In React function starting with “use”, is called a Hook.

Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). 

They let you “hook into” different React features.

> [!WARNING]
> **Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** 
> 
> You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions,
> 
> but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. 
> 
> You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.
